Challenge 5

The module consists of two parts:

An emergency financial planner that enables members to assess their current savings and determine if they have sufficient funds for emergency purposes.

A retirement financial planner that predicts the performance of the retirement portfolio over 30 and 10 years by making an API call to Alpaca via the Alpaca SDK, utilizing historical price data for Monte Carlo simulations.
